TODO:

All list boxes need to allow selection of multiple items
When an index is selected on the lstAll* box it needs to show it's childs parts
	This could probably be eaily implemented with my current selction changed method,
	Need to add more handlers and more case swith variable, but should be possible
Need methods to clear lstboxes
